I chose ChatGPT to find TV Series similar to series that I've watched.


## Why?

**ChatGPT** has the best "learning" technology, as it recommended the best series that fits my taste.

I gave it couple TV series I've watched and based on them it generated series that I've seen already and I liked them, but didn't give them to "learning input"

## Comparison to Google Bard

**Google Bard** gave me the result that wasn't really fighting for me and it wasn't even close to TV Series that I gave it to analyze.

It sticked to one series that I provided and gave me propositions based on that one only.

The only one that fits is *"Love, Dead & Robots."*

## More Input
After giving **ChatGPT** more information it was even more precise about my taste.

**Google Bard** on the other hand was... even worse I feel
